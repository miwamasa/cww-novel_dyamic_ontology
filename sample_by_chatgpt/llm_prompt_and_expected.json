## Task: Ontology Alignment & Merge for Factory -> GHG Reporting

INPUT:
- Ontology A (FactoryProduction) and Ontology B (GHGReport) are provided as RDF triples / JSON-LD.
- There is instance data: Batch_2025_11_01 produced 1000 units of WidgetX.

TASKS (respond as JSON with fields: mappings, merged_triples, contradictions, resolution_suggestions, competency_questions):

1) Propose mappings between Ontology A and Ontology B (format: A_term -> B_term, confidence 0..1).
2) Produce merged triples (in Turtle-like array form) that link ProductionBatch to EmissionEntry and include computed emissions.
3) List potential logical contradictions (if any) arising from merging (max 5).
4) For each contradiction, propose 1-3 resolution strategies (priority-ranked).
5) Propose 3 competency questions (SPARQL-style) that validate the merged ontology.

EXPECTED (example) output:
{
  "mappings": [
    {"A":"ProductionBatch", "B":"EmissionEntry", "confidence":0.95},
    {"A":"quantity", "B":"activity", "confidence":0.98},
    {"A":"Batch_2025_11_01", "B":"Entry_1", "confidence":0.85}
  ],

    ":Entry_1 :emissions "750"^^xsd:decimal .",
    ":EmissionReport_2025_11 :hasSource :Entry_1 ."
  ],
  "contradictions": [
    "A requires quantity to be present but B assumes activity optional"
  ],
  "resolution_suggestions": [
    {"contradiction":"A requires quantity...", "strategies":["make activity mandatory in merged schema", "add provenance and keep both as optional with check"]}
  ],
  "competency_questions": [
    "What is total emissions for Factory F1 in November 2025?",
    "List emissionFactors used for WidgetX process entries."
  ]
}
